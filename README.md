This project optimizes school meal planning for students aged 9-12, balancing nutrition, cost-effectiveness, and USDA compliance. Using an optimization model, we design meal plans that meet dietary requirements while minimizing costs. The dataset integrates nutritional data from Kaggle, cost data from BLS, and USDA guidelines. The model adapts to dietary restrictions, ensuring inclusivity and affordability. Key results demonstrate significant cost savings while maintaining nutritional standards. Future improvements include continuous decision variables for enhanced optimization.
